          <p>Method:</p>

          <p>
            Heat 1/2 cup of the broth in a pot until simmering, add saffron and
            set aside for 10 minutes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Add rice and stir very gently to distribute. Top with artichokes and
            peppers, and cook without stirring, until most of the liquid is
            absorbed, 15 to 18 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, add reserved
            shrimp and mussels, tucking them down into the rice, and cook again
            without stirring, until mussels have opened and rice is just tender,
            5 to 7 minutes more. (Discard any mussels that don’t open.)
